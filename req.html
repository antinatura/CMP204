      <td>
          To follow the best practice, HTML, CSS and JavaScript have all been contained in seperate files.
          No &lt;script&gt; or &lt;style&gt; tags that have been used contain actual code - instead they link the appropriate file that contains the code that is being used. 
          Furthermore jQuery and vanilla JavaScript have seperate files as well.</td>
